# DATA1200-ANN-Project

## Short Description
This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify the type of drug present in patients based on their medical data. The model uses features such as patient age, blood pressure, and other factors to predict which drug type is most likely prescribed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3
- Libraries used:
  - NumPy
  - TensorFlow
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn

---

### Dataset
This project uses the `drugdataset.csv` file, which contains medical data for patients. The dataset includes patient features such as age, blood pressure, etc., and the task is to predict the drug type prescribed to the patient.

- The `drugdataset.csv` file is located in the root directory of this repository.
- Make sure the dataset is in the same directory as your Python script, or adjust the file path in your code accordingly.

### Installing
To get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash git clone https://github.com/tadelleg/DATA1200-ANN-Project.git ```


2. Navigate to the project directory:
     ```cd DATA1200-ANN-Project ```


3. Install the required Python libraries:
     ```pip install -r requirements.txt```


---

### Running the ANN Model
To train the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, you can run the Jupyter notebook:
     `jupyter notebook DATA1200 - Assignment 4 - ANN Drug Classification.ipynb`

- This will open the notebook in your browser, and you can interactively run the cells to train the model on the dataset (drugdataset.csv) and evaluate the results.
